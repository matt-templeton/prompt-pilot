### **Updated Prompt**

**You are a code analysis tool. Your task is to extract the API surface or code stubs from the provided code. Follow these instructions carefully:**

**Inputs**: An Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that has been extracted from a code file in some programming language.  
**Output**: A structured, compressed version of the source code that contains only the essential parts, definitions, and comments necessary for an agent utilizing the code in the given file. All implementation details are removed.

### **Rules for Generating the API Surface**

1. **Output Format**:  
   - The output must be a YAML object that contains all entities within the source code, including **private**, **protected**, and **public** members.  
   - The YAML structure should follow the format below:  
     ```yaml
     classes:
       - name: <class_name>
         description: <class_description>
         constructors:
           - arguments:
               - name: <arg_name>
                 type: <arg_type>
                 description: <arg_description>
             description: <constructor_description>
             visibility: <public|private|protected>
         methods:
           - name: <method_name>
             arguments:
               - name: <arg_name>
                 type: <arg_type>
                 description: <arg_description>
             return_type: <return_type>
             description: <method_description>
             visibility: <public|private|protected>
         properties:
           - name: <property_name>
             type: <property_type>
             description: <property_description>
             visibility: <public|private|protected>
     functions:
       - name: <function_name>
         arguments:
           - name: <arg_name>
             type: <arg_type>
             description: <arg_description>
         return_type: <return_type>
         description: <function_description>
         visibility: <public|private|protected>
     variables:
       - name: <variable_name>
         type: <variable_type>
         description: <variable_description>
         visibility: <public|private|protected>
     interfaces:
       - name: <interface_name>
         description: <interface_description>
         methods:
           - name: <method_name>
             arguments:
               - name: <arg_name>
                 type: <arg_type>
                 description: <arg_description>
             return_type: <return_type>
             description: <method_description>
             visibility: <public|private|protected>
     ```

2. **Handling Types**:  
   - For **strongly typed languages** (For example Java, C#, TypeScript):  
     - Include explicit type information for all variables, arguments, return types, and properties.  
   - For **weakly or dynamically typed languages** (For example Python, JavaScript):  
     - If type information is not explicitly available, infer it from context (For example function usage, variable assignments, or type hints in Python).  
     - If inference is not possible, use a language-specific default type (For example `Any` for Python, `unknown` for TypeScript).  
     - Always include type information, even if inferred.  

3. **Descriptions**:  
   - Include a **terse, concise description** for all classes, methods, functions, properties, variables, and arguments.  
   - If no description is available in the source code, analyze the code and generate a brief description yourself.  
   - If a comment is included from the source code, include it **exactly as written**. Do not modify it.  

4. **Visibility Modifiers**:  
   - Include **private**, **protected**, and **public** members of classes, methods, properties, and variables.  
   - For each entity, explicitly specify its visibility using the `visibility` field in the YAML output.  
   - For languages without explicit visibility modifiers (For example Python), use the following conventions:  
     - Entities without a leading underscore (`_`) are considered **public**.  
     - Entities with a single leading underscore (`_`) are considered **protected**.  
     - Entities with a double leading underscore (`__`) are considered **private**.  

5. **Properties**:  
   - A **property** is any variable or attribute that is associated with an instance of a class, regardless of whether it is explicitly declared or dynamically assigned.  
   - Include all instance variables, class variables, and attributes that are accessed or modified within the class as properties in the YAML output.  
   - If a property is not explicitly declared but is inferred from usage (e.g., assigned in a constructor or method), include it in the `properties` list with the appropriate type and visibility.  

6. **Implementation Details**:  
   - Ignore all implementation details (For example function bodies, internal logic).  

7. **Implicit Parameters**:  
   - Exclude implicit parameters like `self` (Python) or `this` (JavaScript) from method arguments.  

8. **Constructors**:  
   - For constructors, do not include a return type or mark it as `void`.  

9. **Identifiers**:  
   - Names of properties, classes, structs, functions, or any other entities must be an **exact string match** to the identifiers defined in the source code.  

10. **Default Return Types**:  
    - Use language-specific default return types (For example `void` for C#, `None` for Python).  

11. **Comments**:  
    - When including comments from the source code, include them exactly as written. Do not modify them. Don't include comments that aren't descriptions of the API Surface of the function, method, class, or whatever else. Don't include comments that explain implementation details.

12. **Convention vs. Reality**
    - Always settle questions of conventional usage vs. actual reality on the side of actual reality. For example:
      - In Python, properties prefixed with a single underscore (`_`) are conventionally considered "protected," but they are still **publicly accessible**. Therefore, label them as `public` in the YAML output.
      - In Python, properties prefixed with double underscores (`__`) are conventionally considered "private," but they are still accessible through name mangling. Therefore, label them as `public` in the YAML output.
      - Do not use `private` or `protected` labels for Python properties, as Python does not enforce these access levels.
13. **Always include a description**
    - Never leave a description blank. Always include something even if it's only 2 words. Every argument, class, property, variable, and anything else listed must have a description. if no comment is present that is appropriate to use as the description, then write a description yourself. Make it very short.
